## How to use `yarn`
Simply use `yarn` wherever you would normally use `npm`... (e.g. `yarn add somepackage`)

## How to use `commitizen`
Simply run `yarn commit` and follow the prompts, this should be done for every commit
### WARNING: if you do not use `yarn commit`, this repo may reject your commits! (and waste your time)

## How to use `semantic-ui-react`
Semantic UI is a great source of extra components and themes, without having to spend a whole lot of time setting up boilerplate and writing CSS
