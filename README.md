## Password Validation 
https://upmostly.com/tutorials/build-a-password-strength-meter-react
https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn
zxcvbn is a low budget password strength estimator, the implementation of this package enables higher secuirty, flexibilty and usability. The package takes into account common names and words, as well as keyboard patterns.
Passwords are reated as followed. Our password strength allowed is ranked as anything equal or higher than 2.  
- 0 # too guessable: risky password. (guesses < 10^3)
- 1 # very guessable: protection from throttled online attacks. (guesses < 10^6)
- 2 # somewhat guessable: protection from unthrottled online attacks. (guesses < 10^8)
- 3 # safely unguessable: moderate protection from offline slow-hash scenario. (guesses < 10^10)
- 4 # very unguessable: strong protection from offline slow-hash scenario. (guesses >= 10^10)
