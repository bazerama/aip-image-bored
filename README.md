# TerribleOceanMissiles [![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to use `yarn`
Simply use `yarn` wherever you would normally use `npm`... (e.g. `yarn add somepackage`)
A fast, reliable and secure dependency management package, sometimes better than NPM itself!
More information and docs [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

## How to use `commitizen`
Simply run `yarn commit` and follow the prompts, this should be done for every commit
Every commit with commitizen should follow the standard model: `commitType(targetOfChange): shortDescription`
Currently, `husky` has not been enabled, but please utilise commitizen...
### WARNING: if you do not use `yarn commit`, this repo may reject your commits!

## How to use `semantic-ui-react`
Semantic UI is a great source of extra components and themes, without having to spend a whole lot of time setting up boilerplate and writing CSS
To use Semantic UIs components in this repo, please see their [docs](https://react.semantic-ui.com)
To override style or set themes, please view the themes config in `src/semantic-ui/theme.config` and the overrides in `src/semantic-ui/site`

## Branching Strategy
A simple take on the [Azure DevOps strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)
This includes branches for `fix/*`, `feat/*`, `hotfix/*` and `project/*`
Branch type should be decided based on the scope of the task(s)

## StyleCI
This project has StyleCI enabled. Upon every pushed commit StyleCI will ensure that your code follows all rules set for the repository. If it detects any code that breaks the styling rules, it will create a new branch, make the required changes to correct the styling issues, and then send a pull request.

The following are the rules StyleCI will check against:
- tab-width: 4
- use-tabs: false
- print-width: 120
- double-quotes: false
- trailing-commas: es5
- semicolons: true
- arrow-parens: avoid
- bracket-spacing: true

## Password Validation 
https://upmostly.com/tutorials/build-a-password-strength-meter-react
https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn
zxcvbn is a low budget password strength estimator, the implementation of this package enables higher secuirty, flexibilty and usability. The package takes into account common names and words, as well as keyboard patterns.
Passwords are reated as followed. Our password strength allowed is ranked as anything equal or higher than 2.  
- 0 # too guessable: risky password. (guesses < 10^3)
- 1 # very guessable: protection from throttled online attacks. (guesses < 10^6)
- 2 # somewhat guessable: protection from unthrottled online attacks. (guesses < 10^8)
- 3 # safely unguessable: moderate protection from offline slow-hash scenario. (guesses < 10^10)
- 4 # very unguessable: strong protection from offline slow-hash scenario. (guesses >= 10^10)
